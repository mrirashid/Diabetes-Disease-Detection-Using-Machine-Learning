# Diabetes Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Inspiration
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial to improving patients' quality of life and reducing complications. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to help detect diabetes based on various health parameters, providing a valuable tool for early diagnosis.

## Interesting Facts from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- The dataset contains multiple predictors such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and others that are closely correlated with the onset of diabetes.
- A heatmap of the correlation matrix revealed that plasma glucose concentration (plas) has a strong positive correlation with diabetes diagnosis.
- Box plots and histograms highlighted some significant outliers, suggesting the need for data preprocessing techniques like normalization and binarization.

## Technical Approach

1. Data Preprocessing: Various methods were used to prepare the dataset: 
- Scaling: MinMaxScaler was applied to normalize the features.
- Binarization: Certain thresholds were set to binarize the features.
- Standardization: Applied to ensure that all data is on a consistent scale.
- Visualization: EDA included histograms, density plots, and scatter matrix analysis to explore feature distributions.
2. Modeling: After preprocessing, the dataset can be fed into machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest to predict whether a person has diabetes based on their health metrics.

## Original Development
The development of this project involved multiple stages:
- Data exploration and visualization to gain insights into feature relationships.
- Implementation of various preprocessing techniques like normalization and standardization.
- Application of machine learning algorithms to classify the data and detect diabetes.
###  Get Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions below.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-detection.git
cd diabetes-detection

```
## Pre-installation
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  Set-up
- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

``` bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
- Install the required dependencies:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the data exploration and preprocessing code:
``` bash
python preprocess.py
```

## Challenges
- Handling Outliers: The dataset contains outliers, which required robust handling techniques during normalization and binarization.
- Feature Scaling: Ensuring all features were properly scaled was necessary for improving model accuracy.
- Correlation Insights: Understanding the complex relationships between variables like glucose levels and diabetes diagnosis helped in refining the feature selection process.
